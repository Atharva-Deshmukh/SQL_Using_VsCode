- Switch case
- Normalisation of DB (hence we store data in multiple tables)
- Add notes of normalisation in 15.Joins.sql as reason we have joins in the first place

- Handling case sensitivity in SQL

since SQL is not case sensitive, is this a valid statement in MySQL?
"""
SElect * from myTable;

Yes ✅ that’s valid in MySQL.

Here’s why:

🔹 Case sensitivity in SQL

SQL keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.) are not case-sensitive in MySQL and in ANSI SQL.

So SELECT, select, SeLeCt, or SElect → all mean the same.

Identifiers (table names, column names) depend on the database system and its settings:

In MySQL:

Database names & table names → case-sensitive on Linux/Unix (because MySQL uses the underlying OS file system, which is case-sensitive), but not case-sensitive on Windows.

Column names & aliases → not case-sensitive.

🔹 Your example
SElect * from myTable;


✅ SElect works fine (keywords are case-insensitive).

⚠️ myTable → validity depends on how the table was created and OS:

If table is created as CREATE TABLE myTable (...) →

On Windows: myTable, MYTABLE, MyTable → all work.

On Linux: must use the exact case myTable.
