                                            What is a DB?
                                            -------------

- The structured organization of data of related data that is stored and accessed electronically. 
- It is designed to store large amounts of information in such a way that allows 
  for efficient retrieval and manipulation.

- Includes schemas, records, and constraints
- MANAGED USING DML (Data Manipulation Language) for operations like adding and updating data.

Advantages of a Database:
-------------------------
- Efficient Data Management
- Scalability: Databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and can grow as the data volume increases.
- Data Security: Many databases provide built-in security features like access control.
- Data Integrity: DBMS help maintain data consistency, ensuring the accuracy of stored information.


Disadvantages of a Database:
---------------------------
- Complexity: Setting up and managing a database system can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge.
- Cost: Enterprise-level database solutions can be expensive due to hardware, software, and maintenance costs.

                                            What is Schema?
                                            ---------------

- The structural design or blueprint of a database. It defines how data is organized within the database, 
   including the tables, fields, relationships, and constraints. 
- Essentially, a schema provides a logical view of the database.

- Specified by DDL (Data Definition Language).

Advantages of Schema:
-------------------------
- Organization: A schema provides a clear and organized structure for how data is stored, making it easier to Management
- Consistency: Once a schema is defined, it ensures consistency in the format and structure of data entered into the database.


Disadvantages of Schema:
---------------------------
- Limited Flexibility: Once a schema is defined, it can be difficult to modify.
- Dependency on DDL (Data Definition Language): Any changes to the schema require updates to the DDL, 
  which can be time-consuming and complex.

                                    SCHEMAS AND DBs Differ as per the server
                                    ----------------------------------------

- In MySQL, schema = database. They are synonyms.

Example:

CREATE SCHEMA school;
CREATE DATABASE school;   -- Same thing


When you say separate schemas, in MySQL it literally means separate databases inside the same 
MySQL server instance.

Unlike Oracle (where schema â‰  database, and schemas are under a single DB), 
MySQL treats them interchangeably.
