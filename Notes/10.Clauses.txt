                                        Clauses in English language
                                        ---------------------------

A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate (verb).

Examples:
- “She runs.” → Independent clause (can stand alone).
- “Because she was tired” → Dependent clause (cannot stand alone).

So in English, clauses are building blocks of sentences.

                                        -----------------------

In SQL, a clause is a part of a query that performs a specific task.
Think of them as building blocks of SQL statements, just like clauses in English build sentences.

                                        Categories of SQL clauses
                                        -------------------------

Selection Clauses → SELECT, DISTINCT
Source Clauses → FROM, JOIN
Filtering Clauses → WHERE, HAVING, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL, EXISTS
Grouping & Aggregation Clauses → GROUP BY, HAVING
Sorting & Limiting Clauses → ORDER BY, LIMIT
Set Clauses → UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT (not all supported in MySQL)

In short:
-----------
- In English, a clause = subject + verb (part of sentence).
- In SQL, a clause = building block of a query (e.g., WHERE, GROUP BY).
