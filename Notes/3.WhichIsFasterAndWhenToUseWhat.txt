SQL vs NoSQL: Which is Faster? When to choose what?

Neither is universally faster than the other. It depends on the use case / requirement

NoSQL databases can offer faster performance in certain scenarios:
------------------------------------------------------------------
- High write throughput and large datasets
- You need to handle large, unstructured data sets, like social media data or logs
- The application requires horizontal scalability to accommodate high traffic and big data
- Simple read/write operations (key-value) storage
- Real-time applications and caching (In-memory NoSQL databases like Redis offer extremely 
  low latency for caching and real-time data access.)
- You are dealing with applications requiring frequent changes in data structures.

When to Choose SQL?
--------------------
- Data consistency and transactional integrity are critical (e.g., banking systems, 
  customer relationship management).
- The application needs a well-defined schema and structured data.
- Complex queries and relational data are involved.
- Applications requiring multi-row transactions (such as inventory management) 
  benefit from SQLâ€™s robust features.
