                                                DB Sharding
                                                -----------

- The process of storing a large database across multiple machines. 
- A single machine, or database server, can store and process only a limited amount of data. 
  Database sharding overcomes this limitation by splitting data into smaller chunks, called shards, 
  and storing them across several database servers. 
- All database servers usually have the same underlying technologies, and they work together to 
  store and process large volumes of data.

Why is database sharding important?
- As users grow, database becomes a bottleneck if too many users attempt to read/write information 
  simultaneously. 
- The application slows down and affects customer experience. Database sharding is one of the 
  methods to solve this problem because it enables parallel processing of smaller datasets across shards.

Alternatives to DB sharding
- Vertical scaling, replication

Methods of sharding
- Range based, hash based - No need to know in depth
