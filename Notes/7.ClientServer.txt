Every DB consists of 2 components:
- Client => Used for interaction
- Server => Used for storing actual data

In most of the use cases:
- Client = Windows
- Server = Linux/Unix due to security


In Enterprises, teams install only client on their local
Server is not installed on local because its very data-heavy and costly

Clients are of two types:
- GUI
- Command line
