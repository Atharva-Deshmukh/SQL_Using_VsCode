                                            What is a connection?
                                            --------------------

- A connection is simply a communication channel between a MySQL client (like Workbench, VS Code extension, 
  application, or CLI) and the MySQL server.
- Each connection usually uses TCP/IP (default port 3306)

In MySQL, schema = database (they are synonyms).

A connection is made to a server instance (on host/port), not to a schema.

When you create a new connection in Workbench, it asks for a Default Schema.
That doesn’t mean the connection is restricted to that schema.

It just means:
When you open the connection, Workbench will automatically USE <schema_name>; for you.
That schema will be expanded in the left panel so you can immediately see its tables.

But you can still query other schemas by prefixing them (other_db.table_name) or by switching with USE other_db;.

USE hr;
SELECT * FROM employees;
USE sales;
SELECT * FROM orders;


So → Connections in MySQL are not bound permanently to a schema. They just have a starting/default schema.

This behaviour varies as per the DB
