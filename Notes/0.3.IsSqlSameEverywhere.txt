The SQL language varies across different database systems.

All of them are based on the SQL standard (ANSI/ISO SQL), but each vendor extends it differently, 
adds proprietary features, and sometimes interprets parts of the standard in their own way.

1. Core SQL (Mostly Same Everywhere)

    Things like:

    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOIN
    CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE
    Basic data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE)

    ➡ These are almost identical across MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANSI SQL → ; is the official statement terminator (especially for multiple statements).
MySQL → Required in CLI, optional in Workbench for single statements, required for multiple.
