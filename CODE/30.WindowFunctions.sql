                                    What are Window Functions?
                                    -------------------------

- Basically, Window functions operate over a window of rows

- Difference from normal GROUP BY aggregate functions:
  GROUP BY collapses rows into a single row.
  Window functions keep all rows, but add extra calculated values alongside them.

                                    Real-Life Use Cases
                                    -------------------

- Ranking students/employees by marks, salary, etc.
- Running totals / moving averages in finance or sales.
- Comparing with previous/next row (e.g., stock price change compared to yesterday).

                            Can we use Aggregate Functions as Window Functions?
                            ---------------------------------------------------

âœ… Yes. Any aggregate function can be used as a window function by adding OVER(...).

                                TYPES OF WINDOW FUNCTIONS
                                -------------------------

(A) Aggregate Window Functions

These are the same aggregate functions you already know, but applied over a window.
    SUM()
    AVG()
    COUNT()
    MIN()
    MAX()
ðŸ‘‰ Instead of collapsing rows into one, they return a value for each row.
