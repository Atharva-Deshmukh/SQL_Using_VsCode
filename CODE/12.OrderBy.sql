-- The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

-- Default is ASC (ascending)

-- For descending order, we need to write DESC explicitly
SELECT * FROM Product
ORDER BY Price DESC;

-- To sort any column alphabetically
SELECT * FROM Product 
ORDER BY ProductName;


/* SORTING WITH MULTIPLE COLUMNS
---------------------------------

- When you use ORDER BY with multiple columns, SQL sorts in this sequence:
- First, it sorts by the first column.
- If there are ties (same values) in the first column, it looks at the second column.
- If there are still ties, it looks at the third column, and so onâ€¦
- If all columns are the same, the row order is arbitrary (unless you add something else to break ties).

-- Multi column sorting
SELECT * FROM Product
ORDER BY CategoryId ASC, ProductId DESC, Price ASC;
